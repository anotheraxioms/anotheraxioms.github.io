Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images on screens, including virtual reality headsets, or playing certain video games, including the Game. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness in particular) when exposed to flashing lights, you should consult your doctor prior to playing the Game. Stop playing the Game and consult a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: convulsions; eye or muscle twitching; loss of consciousness or awareness; altered vision; involuntary movements; or disorientation. Another Axiom is not liable for any death, injury, or health complications resulting from any epileptic symptoms or conditions which may occur during or as a result of your use of the Game. To reduce the likelihood of a seizure or epileptic symptoms do not play the Game when tired or need sleep and take 10 or 15-minute breaks every 30 minutes while playing the Game.</li><li class="list-item white arrow-icon top-aligned-icon">Motion Sickness. <br/><br/>Playing video games (especially virtual reality games), including the Game, may cause motion sickness in some users. If you feel dizzy or nauseous when playing the Game, stop playing and rest. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or engage in other demanding or strenuous activities until you feel better. To limit the risk of motion sickness while playing the Game, do not use the Game when you are tired, need sleep, are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, are hungover, have digestive problems, are under emotional stress or anxiety, or when suffering from cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or earaches or other health issues which may increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.</li><li class="list-item white arrow-icon top-aligned-icon">Repetitive Motion Injuries and Eyestrain. <br/><br/>Playing video games, including the Game, can make your muscles, joints, skin, or eyes hurt. To avoid problems such as tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, skin irritation, or eyestrain: avoid excessive play; take a 10 to 15-minute break every 30 minutes while playing the Game; if your hands, wrists, arms, eyes, or other parts of your body become tired or sore while playing, or if you feel symptoms such as tingling, numbness, burning, or stiffness, stop and rest for several hours before playing again; and if you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other discomforts during or after playing the Game, stop playing and consult a doctor.</li><li class="list-item white arrow-icon top-aligned-icon">Play Area Precautions. <br/><br/>Give yourself plenty of room to play the Game. Always be aware of your surroundings when playing the Game. While playing the Game in virtual reality you will be moving around the play area and using your hands to control gameplay. Make sure the play area is clear of furniture, objects, and other people that could be bumped into during gameplay. Please ensure that you are not near other people, stairs, balconies, windows, walls, furniture, or other objects that may pose a danger to you or could be damaged or injured during or immediately after using the Game. All objects that may pose tripping hazards, could cause injury or could be damaged as the result of your contact with them while playing the Game should be removed from the play area prior to your or your family members playing the Game. A minimum six-feet-by-six-feet unobstructed play area is recommended for the safe enjoyment of the Game. Never handle sharp or dangerous objects while playing the Game. Due to the immersive nature of the Game, sound volumes should be kept at low enough levels that you are able to maintain awareness of your surroundings while playing the Game so as not to damage your hearing. You should not use the Game if your awareness of your surroundings is impaired by lack of sleep, drugs, alcohol, the effects of a hang-over, stress, anxiety, or when suffering from a cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or other illnesses.<br/>‍</li></ul></div><section id="SectionK" class="text-block left-align"><div class="body-text regular full-width">K.
